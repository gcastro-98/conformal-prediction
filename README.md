# Conformal prediction
Uncertainty quantification for distribution-free and data-agnostic problems is applied in terms of conformal prediction (CP) methodologies. 
In particular, this is applied to regression problems involving both exchangeable and time-series data. 
This work was carried out as part of (UB 2023) MSc thesis development.

## Exchangeable data

### Toy problem

Before dealing with a more complex datasets, we will study how CP performs in the toy problem proposed in this
